        Two "night time" :) developers are doing all the work, check out the <a href="https://github.com/syncloud/syncloud/graphs/punch-card">punch card</a> and we started the project as we could not find any properly working tool for making "cloud" files available in offline on our devices and vise-versa.<br><br>
        We have a lot of ideas to implement, but we also would like to see other people requests.
