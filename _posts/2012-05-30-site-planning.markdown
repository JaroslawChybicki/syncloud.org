    Hi there!
    <br/><br/>
    We are developers from Syncloud project. We are Boris and Vladimir.
    <br/><br/>
    We would like to show what we were working on for the last year to the wider audience. We want to get our software useful meaning to be used by somebody. We are concentrating on things that will allow average consumers to learn about our software, install it and enjoy it. We also extremely need a feedback from real people.
    <br/><br/>
    So we have started working on this site using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>. We're also entering <a href="https://github.com/syncloud/syncloud/issues">issues</a> for tracking what should be done before our first release.
