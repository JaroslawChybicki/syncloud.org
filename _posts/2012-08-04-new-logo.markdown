        Take a look at the top-left corner of this page. Yeah, we have updated our logo!
        <br/>
        Our previous logo was just a random image from Internet. So we decided that Syncloud project is worth having it's own unique logo. We are updating pages related to Syncloud on all other web sites, such as <a href="https://github.com/syncloud">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/syncloud">ohloh</a>. We're also changing icon in our client application. This is seemed to be the last thing which should be done before our first official release.
