<p>
    Syncloud has got it's first confirmed user! <a href="http://qt-apps.org/usermanager/search.php?username=dequire">James C.</a> reported problems using Syncloud application at <a href="http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php?content=152242">Qt-Apps.org</a>. Despite his experience is not a success story, it's good news for Syncloud project because there is at least one man on the earth who was interested in what we are doing. James experienced some problems with configuration and made <a href="https://github.com/syncloud/syncloud/issues/17">a feature request</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    We already discussed possibility to provide some benefits to early users of Syncloud. We might come up with some incentive strategy for early users who provide feedback for future releases.
