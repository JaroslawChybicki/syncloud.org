    <p>
        We just have put disk image with Syncloud application for Mac OS X. For installing just <a href="http://syncloud.org/download">download</a> disk image, mount it and then drug &amp; drop Syncloud.app to Applications on your Mac OS X. Main functionality of Syncloud is supported on Mac OS X, however there are some small issues with running application on startup and activation of user interface from syncloud icon. We will fix these issues after our first release.
