        <h5>Team</h5>
        Two "night time" :) developers are doing all the work, check out the <a href="https://github.com/syncloud/syncloud/graphs/punch-card">punch card</a>. We started the project as we could not find any properly working tool for making "cloud" files available in offline on our devices and vice versa.<br/>
        We have a lot of ideas to implement, but we also would like to see other people requests.

        <h5>Join</h5>
        If you want to contribute to the project check <a href="https://github.com/syncloud/syncloud">syncloud github page</a> and fork us.

        <h5>Build Server</h5>
        We have our own <a href="http://build.syncloud.org">TeamCity build server</a> which builds artifacts for all supported platforms on every code change.
