        <h5>Planning</h5>
        We are trying to keep our project as informal as possible. Thus we're discussing our plans during our lunch. Although we're keeping our <a href="https://github.com/syncloud/core/issues">issue tracker</a> up to date. We are using it as both bug tracker and task board.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h5>Build Server</h5>
        We have our own <a href="http://build.syncloud.org">TeamCity build server</a>. It builds artifacts for all platforms for latest release and also for current master version on every code change.
